## About Myourmiles

This discord bot is made for the discord server "DCS Stories," a space for fanfiction writers of the popular anime "That time I got Reincarnated As a Slime."

Myourmiles was inspired by PokeTwo and was originally intended to be a simple catch-and-battle bot. After some consideration, I decided to make the bot have it's own lore in the Tensura universe. The "player" is an adventurer starting in the Blumund Royal Capital a few years before Rimuru's reincarnation.
